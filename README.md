# My Digital Flashcards


A FrontEnd web application to create decks of flashcards, which can store these created decks into an api, and upon request, retrieve them to be studied.


Rendering of a full-stack study tool application using React, React hooks and stateful components. Built website routing using React Router and made Fetch API calls using RESTful design principles.

Languages, frameworks, and packages used include:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript ES6
* React (with hooks)

### The code provided shows the FrontEnd design only.  Backend server has not been created.  The Data -db.json file is to mimic what the server would provide.  However, if there was a working server, the final product would work similar to this [Flashcards Example Layout](http://project-flashcards-example.herokuapp.com/)
